# odin-recipes
HTML project following the ODIN project to create a simple collection of websites. 
This project is based on the assignment outlined in the ODIN Project lesson titled 
"Project: Recipes. Src: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

The aim of this project is to put in to practise a number of the skills that I have learnt
so far following the ODIN project. This will include everything I have 
learnt so far regarding HTML, such as inserting paragraphs, headings, 
bold and italic text, pictures etc. I will also be focusing on making
sure that I am adhering to best practises when coding such as by leaving
concise and clear comments on my code and using the terminal wherever
possible. I will also be making sure to be commiting often to git and
uploading my work to Github.

This is my first coding project, hopefully not the last lol
